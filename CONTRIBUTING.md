OpenSDP invites contributions which will help education analysts use data to
address challenges facing our schools. As our community grows, we will be
formalizing our contribution processes. In the near term, we invite you to use
our resources freely. If you see a way to make them better or have suggestions
for new content, please submit feedback either through our Slack team
[(opensdp.slack.com)](https://opensdp.slack.com) or by submitting an issue to the
relevant repository. We welcome pull requests with updates and corrections to
our existing analytic packages. If you are interested in sharing a repository
of your own work with the education community through OpenSDP, please reach out
to us at opensdp@gse.harvard.edu.
