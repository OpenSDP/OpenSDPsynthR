# Introduction
SDP's College-Going Success analyses are a set of data visualizations about 
student pathways through high school and college. We adapted these analyses for the 
OpenSDP project from SDP's College-Going toolkit (available for download at
[sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit](www.sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit)). 
The toolkit was designed as a tutorial on college-going data. Though we maintain
the toolkit's step-by-step instructions, we intend these analyses to go beyond 
tutorial. Furthering the mission of OpenSDP, this work 
will allow the research-practitioner community to discuss and collaborate
on high impact analysis on this important topic. We invite
you to contribute to our collection of policy-relevant data visualizations.

## About OpenSDP
OpenSDP is a set of free, iterable data analytic tools that will enable 
analysts in state and local agencies to conduct sophisticated, research-based 
analyses with their own administrative data. These tools will enable users 
to efficiently produce useful data on the performance of the local education 
system and its students, in order to provide more accurate information to 
leaders of state and district school systems. The tools will also help with 
visualization, allowing analysts to communicate findings from sophisticated 
analyses to decision makers more effectively.

## Structure of Analyses
The college-going analyses are divided into six sections:
 
- Attainment Along the Education Pipeline
- On-Track in Ninth Grade
- High School Graduation
- College Enrollment
- College Enrollment Among Highly Qualified Graduates
- College Persistence

With each analysis, you will find:

- A picture of the analysis, based on the synthetic data;
- **Purpose:** an explanation of each analysisâ€™ value and its ability to 
support understanding of high school completion and college-going success in 
your agency;
- **Required Analysis File Variables:** the variables from the analysis file you 
will need;
- **Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** a list of restrictions that you 
will apply to define the sample for the analysis;
- **Ask Yourself:** a set of questions to help interpret results and invite 
deeper inquiry;
- **Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** further analyses you may conduct to
understand underlying causes or interventions needed (this section is included 
in some but not all analyses) 
- **Analytic Technique:** how to produce the analysis step-by-step using your 
analysis file and code in Stata.

# Loading the OpenSDP Dataset
TBD

# Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions
One of the most important decisions in running each analysis is 
defining the sample. Each analysis corresponds to a different part of the education 
pipeline and as a result requires different cohorts of students.

If you are using the synthetic data we have provided,
the sample restrictions have been predefined and are included below. If 
you run this code using your own agency data, change the sample 
restrictions based on your data. Note that you will have to run these sample restrictions at the beginning of 
your script so they will feed into the rest of your code.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # main suite of R packages to ease data analysis
library(magrittr) # allows for some easier pipelines of data
# Read in some R functions that are convenience wrappers
source("R/functions.R")
library(haven) # required for importing .dta files

# Read in global variables for sample restriction
# Agency name
agency_name <- "Agency"

# Ninth grade cohorts you can observe persisting to the second year of college
chrt_ninth_begin_persist_yr2 = 2005
chrt_ninth_end_persist_yr2 = 2005

# Ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time
chrt_ninth_begin_grad = 2005
chrt_ninth_end_grad = 2006

# Ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school one year late
chrt_ninth_begin_grad_late = 2005
chrt_ninth_end_grad_late = 2005

# High school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation
chrt_grad_begin = 2008
chrt_grad_end = 2009

# High school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in college two years after hs graduation
chrt_grad_begin_delayed = 2008
chrt_grad_end_delayed = 2008

# In RStudio these variables will appear in the Environment pane under "Values"
```
Based on the sample data, you will have no more than two cohorts (sometimes only 
one) for analysis. If your own agency data is more extensive, you may decide 
to aggregate results for three or four cohorts to report your results. This 
decision depends on 1) how much historical data you have (you may only have two 
cohorts of data) and 2) what balance to strike between reliability and averaging
away information on recent trends. We suggest you average results for the last 
three cohorts to take advantage of larger sample sizes and improve reliability. 
However, if you have data for more than three cohorts, you may decide to not 
average data out for fear of losing information about trends and recent changes 
in your agency.

# Attainment Along the Education Pipeline
Attainment along the Education Pipeline analyses summarize student attainment 
from ninth grade through college using three milestones: 1) on-time high school
completion, 2) seamless college transition, and 3) persistence to the second 
year of college. 

Through these analyses, you identify drop-offs along the education pipeline for 
students as a group and as subgroups. For different subgroups, these analyses 
illuminate disparities in college attainment by race, family income, high school
attended, and academic achievement. A steep decline in college enrollment from 
high school completion date for specific subgroups may indicate barriers to 
college access. On the other hand, a steep decline from initial college 
enrollment to second-year persistence might suggest students were not prepared 
for rigorous college coursework during high school. 

## Overall Progression

**Purpose:** This analysis tracks the overall percent of ninth graders who 
complete high school on-time, seamlessly enroll in college, and persist to the 
second year of college. To examine the range of attainment at each milestone, 
the minimum and maximum values of any high school are shown. 

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `first_hs_name`
- `ontime_grad`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr2_any`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts for which persistence to the second year of college
can be reported.

**Ask Yourself** 

- Do you notice drop-offs along the pipeline?
- Are differences in agency maxima and minima at different points along the 
pipeline surprising? What might be different about these high schools?
- Are your numbers in line with agency-reported figures in other publicly 
available reports? What might account for differences?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of first-time ninth graders that 
progress to each step along the education pipeline.

## Progression by Student Race/Ethnicity, Among FRPL Students

**Purpose:**  This analysis tracks the percent of ninth graders of different
races/ethnicities who ever qualified for free or reduce price lunch who complete 
high school on-time, seamlessly enroll in college, and persist to the second 
year of college.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `race_ethnicity`
- `frpl_ever`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `ontime_grad`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr2_any`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** 

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts for which persistence to the second year 
of college can be reported. 
- Restrict the analysis to include only students who were ever eligible to 
receive free-or reduced-price lunch throughout their time in your agency, and 
drop any race/ethnic groups with less than 20 students at any point along the 
pipeline.

**Ask Yourself** 

- How do differences between races/ethnicities change along the pipeline when 
only students whoever qualifying for free or reduced price lunch are examined?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of first-time ninth graders 
that progress to each step along the education pipeline.

## Progression by Students' On-Track Status After Ninth Grade

**Purpose:** This analysis tracks the percent of ninth graders at different 
levels of being on-track for graduation who complete high school on-time, 
seamlessly enroll in college, and then persist to the second year of college.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `ontrack_sample`
- `ontrack_end_yr*`
- `cum_gpa_yr*`
- `ontime_grad`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_ninth_yr2_any`


**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** 

- Only include the three most recent ninth grade cohorts for
which persistence to second year of college can be reported.
- Restrict the sample to include only students in the on-track
analytic sample (students who attended the first semester of
ninth grade in the system and never transferred into, or out
of the system).
- Students that obtain Special Education diplomas upon high
school entry should be excluded from the analytic sample if
these students are not required to meet the same graduation
requirements as general education students, and if the
designation can be made.


**Ask Yourself** 

- How does being on-track for graduation after ninth grade relate to on-time 
graduation, seamless enrollment, and second year persistence?
- How does being on-track after ninth grade with a higher GPA compare to being 
on-track with a lower GPA?


**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of first-time ninth graders 
that progressed along the education pipeline.

# On-Track in Ninth Grade

Research suggests that academic performance in ninth grade strongly predicts 
the likelihood of a student dropping out of high school. In this section, you 
examine patterns of student retention and on-time transitions from ninth to 
tenth grade. This information can provide an early warning to an agency with 
students at-risk of dropping out, and might benefit from targeted support early 
in their high school careers.

To explore transitions from ninth to tenth grade, use the following model analyses:

1. Proportion of Students On-Track at the End of Ninth Grade, by high school

2. Ninth to tenth grade transition by on-track status

## Proportion of Students On-Track by High School

**Purpose:** This analysis illustrates what percent of students are on-track 
after ninth grade graduate from each high school and the agency as a whole. 
Different levels of on-track for graduation are distinguished by high school.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `first_hs-Name`
- `first_hs_code`
- `ontrack_endyr1*`
- `cum_gpa_yr1`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** Keep students in ninth grade cohorts 
you can observe graduating high school on time AND are part of the on-track 
sample (attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred into 
or out of the system).

**Ask Yourself**

- How does the percent of students on-track differ by high school (consider 
the overall height of each bar)?
- How does the percent of students on-track for an advanced versus general 
diploma differ by high school (consider the different components of each bar)?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Overall school-level results can be 
disaggregated by student subgroups of interest, (race, FRPL status, and eighth 
grade academic achievement). 

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students on-track at each 
school, and across the agency.

```

## Ninth To Tenth Grade Transition by On-Track Status

**Purpose:** This analysis explores how on-track status after ninth grade 
(the horizontal axis) predicts ontrack status in tenth grade (the vertical axis). 
This analysis is useful for developing early dropout warning indicators for 
at-risk students as early as the second semester of ninth grade. 

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `first_hs_name`
- `first_hs_code`
- `ontrack_endyr1*`
- `cum_gpa_yr1*`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** Keep students in ninth grade cohorts 
you can observe graduating high school on time AND are part of the on-track 
sample (attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred into 
or out of the system).

**Ask Yourself:**

- What percent of those in a specific on-track category at the end of ninth 
grade stay in that same on-track category? For example, what percent of 
off-track ninth graders continue off-track in tenth grade?
- How might you use an early warning system to help students get back on-track 
for graduation?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Identify additional risk factors, 
(chronic absenteeism, prior academic achievement etc.) which can be 
incorporated into analyses like the one above. This could be used to further 
understand which students struggle, why they struggle, and interventions to keep 
them enrolled and engaged.

# High School Graduation

High school graduation is a critical step to higher education. Understanding
trends and variations in high school completion rates across schools and student
subgroups is essential. These analyses reveal the extent to which high schools
may differentially influence student trajectories towards high school
completion. After identifying these high schools, you may conduct deeper
analyses on your own to explore what drives these outcomes. To begin exploring
high school graduation further, use the analyses below: 

1. High School Completion Rates By School
2. High School Completion Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement
3. High School Completion Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles
4. Racial gaps in completion overall and By 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles
5. Enrollment Outcome in Year 4 by On-Track Status at the End of Ninth Grade

## High School Completion Rates By School

**Purpose:** This analysis explores variation in high school completion rates 
across high schools in the system for both on-time and late high school 
graduates.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `hs_diploma`
- `ontime_grad`
- `late_grad`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school one year late

**Ask Yourself**

- Does the ordering of high school completion rates coincide with beliefs key 
stakeholders have about these high schools?

- Which high schools have the highest and lowest completion rates? Do you know 
why?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who complete high 
school by school.

## High School Completion Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement

**Purpose:**  This analysis examines the relationship between academic 
achievement at high school entry and high school completion rates. This 
analysis is useful to identify high schools that beat the odds. High schools 
with similar incoming student achievement profiles but different high school 
graduation rates.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** 

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop any high schools with less than 20 students enrolled in
ninth grade across the cohorts.

**Ask Yourself** 

What might explain differences in high school graduation rates for high schools 
with similar incoming achievement? What might explain differences in incoming
achievement for high schools with similar graduation rates?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** If substantial variation exists after
controlling for average student achievement at high school entry, think about 
how to share this information across schools. To explore mechanisms that drive
school-level differences in high school completion rates, replicate this 
analysis where the x-axis is a middle school at-risk index (e.g. an index that 
accounts for whether students failed a core class, were chronically absent, and 
other information predictive of student achievement in high school) in place of 
8th grade test scores.

**Analytic Technique:** Bivariate scatterplot of school-level average student 
test scores and high school completion rates.

## High School Completion Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles


**Purpose:** This analysis examines variation in completion rates for high 
schools  among students with 8th grade test scores in the same quartile. The 
analysis is useful to explore high school completion rates across schools with 
students in the same quartile or range of achievement. Each high school is 
repeated as a blue bar in each quartile.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile
enrolled in ninth grade across the cohorts.

**Ask Yourself**

- Looking at the average in each quartile (orange bars), how do 8th grade test 
scores relate to high school graduation?
- For each quartile of 8th grade test scores (the blue bars), how do graduation 
rates vary by high school? What is the difference between top and bottom high 
schools in each quartile?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Highlight comparison schools to show 
variation across quartiles and explore reasons why students at different 
schools, but with similar academic profiles at high school entry, are more or 
less likely to graduate.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students, by high school, who 
complete high school and an 8th grade test score quartile for each.

## Racial Gaps in Completion Overall and by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles

**Purpose:** This analysis displays an overall graduation gap by race, and 
examines the extent to which this gap is explained by average differences in 
academic achievement between racial sub-groups at high school entry. The 
analysis is useful to diagnose whether racial gaps in high school result from 
persistent academic achievement gaps that emerge in early grades, or if other 
factors unique to the high school experience drive high school completion rate
differences by race.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop any race/ethnic sub-groups with at least 20 students
in each quartile (for the second graph). You may further
restrict the sample to only include students from the most
representative racial/ethnic sub-groups in your agency.

**Ask Yourself**

- How do racial gaps in graduation rates change after prior achievement is 
accounted for? Do these gaps change for different prior achievement quartiles?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat analyses for only students that 
qualify for free or reduced price lunch (FRPL) to explore if racial gaps are 
better explained by disparities in prior academic achievement and family 
socioeconomic status.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who complete high 
school by race/ethnicity overall, and by race/ethnicity and 8th grade test 
score quartile.

## Enrollment Outcome in Year Four By On-Track Status At the End of Ninth Grade


**Purpose:** This analysis explores how strongly student performance in ninth grade 
predicts high school graduation three years later. Building upon our analysis 
of the relationship between student performance in ninth and tenth grade, the 
analysis assesses the utility of using course-level performance data early in 
studentsâ€™ high school careers to assess risk of non-completion, and target 
students in need of academic and/or socio-emotional support.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `ontrack_grad_hs_sample*`
- `ontrack_endyr1*`
- `cum_gpa_yr1*`
- `status_after_yr4*`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**
- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND are part of the on-track sample
(attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred
into or out of the system).

**Ask Yourself**
- How does on-track status at the end of ninth grade relate to high school 
completion status at the end of four years?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat analyses for only students that 
qualify for free or reduced price lunch (FRPL) to explore whether racial gaps 
are better explained by disparities in prior academic achievement and family
socioeconomic status.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who graduate high 
school within four years, dropout, remain enrolled in high school for a fifth 
year, etc. based on on-track status upon completion of ninth grade.

# College Enrollment

Given the substantial economic and social benefits of a college degree, 
understanding a high schoolsâ€™ role in preparing students to persist through 
college is essential. This section provides a series of analyses that highlight
college-going rates across high schools in your agency. You will consider 
whether high school graduates enroll in colleges and universities well-aligned 
to their  incoming academic qualifications. This is one factor that may increase 
a studentsâ€™ likelihood of college persistence and degree attainment.

To explore these questions, consider the following model analyses:

1. College Enrollment Rates by High School
2. Seamless and Delayed College Enrollment Rate by High School
3. College Enrollment Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement
4. College Enrollment Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quantiles
5. Rates of Non-Enrollment Among Graduates Highly Qualified to Attend Four-Year
Colleges

The following three analyses in College Enrollment include the three Strategic
Performance Indicators (SPIs) SDP has released to provide deeper insight into 
the college-going performance of educational systems. These SPIs were conducted 
using data from a number of SDP's partner agencies. This section of Analyze 
will help you conduct these analyses yourself. You can read more about the SPIs 
at [sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/spi](http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/spi).

6. Gaps in Rates of College Enrollment Between Latino High School Graduates and 
White High School Graduates
7. College Enrollment Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles
8. Undermatch Rates Among Highly Qualified High School Graduates

## College Enrollment Rates by High School

**Purpose:** This analysis provides an agency snapshot of college enrollment 
to understand how patterns of college going for high school graduates vary 
across high schools. By illuminating the extent to which enrollment varies by 
entry time for seamless enrollers and college level (2- vs. 4-year), the 
analysis helps diagnose compositional differences for the college-bound 
population by high school attended.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_ever_w2_grad_2yr`
- `enrl_ever_w2_grad_4yr`
- `hs_diploma`
- `last_hs_code`
- `last_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in 
college the fall after graduation.
- Drop any high schools with less than 20 students in the sample.
- Include only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas (i.e. 
exclude students who received SPED diplomas and other certificates).

**Ask Yourself**
- How do college enrollment rates differ by high schools? Why might certain 
schools have a greater percentage of high school graduates enrolling in college? 
Do certain schools have higher percentages of 2-year or delayed college enrollers?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Replicate this analysis to include 
all first-time ninth graders (i.e. ninth grade cohorts) in place of graduates.
Additionally, create individual high school reports that provide more details 
for school administrators (top enrolling institutions of the schoolâ€™s graduates).

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who enroll in college by high school.

## College Enrollment Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement

**Purpose:** This analysis displays variations in college enrollment rates across 
high schools by examining the extent to which academic achievement at high 
school entry explains variation in college going across high schools. This 
analysis is useful to identify high schools with similar incoming student 
achievement profiles but divergent college enrollment rates; or on the other 
hand, high schools with similar college-going rates but different academic 
performance at high school entry. 

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `last_hs_code`
- `last_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in 
college the fall after graduation AND have non-missing eighth grade test scores.
- Include only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas (i.e. 
exclude students who received SPED diplomas and other certificates).

**Ask Yourself**
- What might explain variation in college enrollment rates for high schools 
with similar incoming achievement? What might explain variation in incoming 
achievement for high schools with similar college enrollment rates?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat this analysis to include all 
first-time ninth graders (i.e. ninth grade cohorts) in place of graduates, 
and explore college enrollment within two years of high school completion. 
Additionally, replicate this analysis to explore the relationship between 
college enrollment and studentsâ€™ ELA achievement at high school entry. Consider 
why schools with similar incoming student profiles may report dramatically 
different college-going rates. Conversely, consider why schools with dissimilar 
student bodies report similar matriculation rates to college.

**Analytic Technique:** Bivariate scatterplot of school-level average student 
test scores and college enrollment rates.

## College Enrollment Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles

**Purpose:** This analysis explores whether variation in college enrollment 
across high schools is similar among low-, middle, and top-achieving students. 
It also considers whether overall variation across schools derives from 
concentrated divergence among students scoring in a particular achievement 
range. Additionally, the analysis facilitates granular school-to-school 
comparisons to identify those especially under-, or over-performing within 
each achievement quartile. Finally, the analysis also helps identify which 
student subgroups require additional resources and support within each school. 


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `qrt_8_math_std`
- `last_hs_code`
- `last_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in 
college the fall after graduation AND have non-missing eighth grade test scores.
- Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile enrolled in 
ninth grade across the cohorts. 
- Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas (i.e. exclude 
students who received SPED diplomas and other certificates).

**Ask Yourself**

- After looking at the average in each quartile (the orange bars), how do 8th 
grade test scores relate to college enrollment? Within each quartile of 8th 
grade test scores (the blue bars), how do enrollment rates vary by high school? 
What is the difference between top and bottom performing high schools in each 
quartile?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat this analysis to include all 
first-time ninth graders (i.e. ninth grade cohorts) in place of graduates, and 
explore college enrollment within two years of high school completion. 
Additionally, replicate this analysis to explore the relationship between 
college enrollment and studentsâ€™ ELA achievement at high school entry. Consider 
why schools with similar incoming student profiles may report dramatically 
different college-going rates. Conversely, consider why schools with distinct 
student bodies may report similar matriculation rates to college.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of graduates who enrolled in 
college by October 1st following their high school graduation year by high 
school and 8th grade test score quartile.

## Rates of College Enrollment by College Type Among Highly Qualified Graduates

**Purpose:** Research consistently finds wide variation in rates of persistence 
and completion across postsecondary institutions. This analysis examines 
whether high school graduates enroll in colleges and universities that provide 
the right academic fit to maximize their chances of completion. "Match"describes 
the extent high school graduates with strong academic records attend colleges
and universities that allow them to take advantage of their ambition and 
abilities. While "matching" to an appropriately selective college is only one 
factor to consider when choosing a postsecondary institution, the implications 
of under-matching (i.e. lower rates of persistence and degree completion) 
suggest students should be encouraged to attend realistic, yet challenging 
postsecondary institutions. 

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `race_ethnicity`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `highly_qualified`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can
observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation.
- Include only graduates who received regular or advanced
diplomas (i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).
- Include only highly qualified high school graduates (i.e.
students who have obtained a high school diploma on time
with 1) a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher and Math/Verbal
SAT score of 1300 or higher, or 2) a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or
higher and Math/Verbal SAT score of 1200 or higher, or 3) a
cumulative GPA of 3.7 or higher and Math/Verbal SAT score
of at least 1100).
- Drop race/ethnic groups with less than 20 students eligible
to attend a four-year university.

**Ask Yourself**

- Among highly qualified students, which race/ethnicities seem to face the 
greatest undermatch rates?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** This analysis leads to important 
questions that warrant further exploration. What factors drive undermatch 
differences across student subgroups and high schools? To what extent is 
undermatching concentrated among first-time college-goers? To what extent is
undermatching driven by studentsâ€™ proximity to 2-year versus 4-year 
institutions? What college aspirations do incoming ninth graders hold, and do 
these aspirations change by the time they enter or complete 12th grade? To 
what extent are teachers, counselors, and administrators supported to work with
students to cultivate postsecondary aspirations and weigh factors in the college
selection process?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of highly qualified graduates 
who do not enroll in college, enroll in 2-year college, and enroll in least 
competitive and unranked 4-year colleges the fall following high school 
graduation.

## Gaps in Rates of College Enrollment Between Latino and White Graduates

**Purpose:** This Strategic Performance Indicator explores gaps in college 
enrollment rates by ethnicity, before and after accounting for differences in 
prior academic achievement, socioeconomic status, and both of these background
characteristics. While the analysis evaluates separately the college enrollment 
gaps between Black and White students and between Latino and White students, 
it can be modified to focus on the gap between any two races or ethnicities.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `last_hs_code`
- `race_ethnicity`
- `test_math_8`
- `frpl_ever`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in 
college the fall after graduation.
-  Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas (i.e. exclude 
students who received SPED diplomas and other certificates).
- Drop race/ethnic groups with less than 20 students eligible to attend a 
four-year university. You may further restrict the sample to only include 
students from the most representative racial/ethnic sub-groups in your agency.

**Ask Yourself**

- How do racial gaps in college enrollment change after prior achievement is 
accounted for? How do these gaps change after socioeconomic status is accounted 
for?
- Do these gaps still exist when you account for both prior achievement and
socioeconomic status? Do they reverse direction, suggesting that minority 
students enroll in college at higher rates when compared with White students with
similar background characteristics?
- Do you observe differences in the degree to which the White-Black gap and 
the White-Latino gap decline after accounting for prior achievement and 
socioeconomic status? If the adjusted gap between White and Latino students, 
for example, is still sizable, what additional barriers may be impeding access 
to college for Latino students? 

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the difference between the proportion of Black 
(or Latino) high school graduates and the proportion of White high school 
graduates who enrolled in collegeâ€”in raw terms and after accounting for 8th 
grade test scores, for eligibility for Free or Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL), 
and for both of these characteristics.

## College Enrollment Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartile Bubbles

**Purpose:** This SPI highlights the variation in college-going rates across high 
schools when students with similar prior achievement are compared. To conduct 
these comparisons, we first sort all incoming ninth-graders into quartiles 
based on their 8th grade test scores. We then examine college-going rates by 
high school among graduates within each of these quartiles.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `last_hs_name`
- `hs_diploma`
- `qrt_8_math_std`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe
enrolling in college the fall after graduation AND have
non-missing eighth grade test scores.
- Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile
enrolled in ninth grade across the cohorts.
- Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas
(i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

**Ask Yourself**

- How do college enrollment rates vary across high schools for students within 
the same quartile of 8th grade test scores (that is, when we compare students 
with similar prior achievement)?

## Undermatch Rates Among Highly Qualified High School Graduates

**Purpose:** This Strategic Performance Indicator examines the prevalence of
"undermatch" in the agencyâ€”that is, the extent to which high school graduates 
with strong academic records pursue enrollment in colleges and universities 
less selective than those for which they are likely qualified. The SPI does so 
by illustrating the rates at which highly qualified graduates are enrolling at 
2-year colleges, less competitive 4-year colleges, or forgoing college 
altogether, instead of pursuing selective colleges that may provide a better 
academic and social fit for these studentsâ€™ potential, ambition, and preparation.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_grad` 
- `highly_qualified`
- `first_college_opeid_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can
observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation.
- Keep only highly qualified high school graduates (i.e. students
who have obtained a high school diploma on time
with 1) a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher and Math/Verbal
SAT score of 1300 or higher, or 2) a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or
higher and Math/Verbal SAT score of 1200 or higher, or 3) a
cumulative GPA of 3.7 or higher and Math/Verbal SAT score
of at least 1100).
- Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas
(i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

**A Note on College Selectivity**

To determine the selectivity of the postsecondary institutions in which high 
school graduates enroll, we typically rely on Barronâ€™s College Rankings. Barronâ€™s 
has developed well-established college selectivity ratings based on the degree 
of admissions competitiveness at four-year colleges and universities. Factors 
used in determining these rankings include the median SAT and ACT scores, high 
school class rankings, and grade point average among incoming college freshmen. 
The seven selectivity rankings Barronâ€™s assigns are "Most Competitive", 
"Highly Competitive," "Very Competitive," "Competitive," "Less Competitive,"
"Non-Competitive," and "Special." As part of this exercise, we have provided 
a simplified table from which the selectivity ratings of the colleges and 
universities included in this dataset can be obtained. In conducting this 
analysis for your own agency, you need to select a source of college 
selectivity ratings, such as Barronâ€™s, and use it in place of the college 
selectivity table used in this exercise.

**Ask Yourself**

- How do college enrollment rates vary across high schools for students within 
the same quartile of 8th grade test scores (that is, when we compare students 
with similar prior achievement)?
- What is the difference between the high schools with the lowest and with the 
highest rates in each quartile?
- Are across-school differences in colleges enrollment rates particularly large 
for students of certain achievement profileâ€”for example, for students with 8th grade test scores in the bottom quartile?

# College Persistence

For many high school graduates, college enrollment is just the first of many 
hurdles on the road to postsecondary success. While considerable attention has 
been paid to challenges that surround college preparedness, access, and 
enrollment, only recently has conversation expanded to consider barriers to 
degree completion. These barriers must be understood and addressed at both the 
secondary and postsecondary levels for college attainment rates to increase. In 
the last section of the education pipeline, you examine patterns of persistence 
to the second year of college to identify early indications of student progress 
towards degree attainment.

To explore college persistence, use the models below:

1. Persistence Rates to the Second Year of College By High School
2. Persistence Across Two-Year and Four-Year Colleges
3. Top Enrolling Colleges and Universities of Agency Graduates

## Persistence Rates to the Second Year of College by High School

**Purpose:** Initial enrollment decisions can dramatically affect higher 
education trajectories and the likelihood of degree attainment. This analysis 
provides a snapshot of persistence to the second year of college by examining
persistence rates across high schools in the system. The analysis illuminates
differences in persistence by level of college first attended (two-year vs. 
four-year). Given another year of sample data, the analysis could also be 
conducted by time of initial entry (seamless vs. delayed enrollment). 

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_any`
- `enrl_grad_persist_4yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_2yr`
- `last_hs_code`
- `last_hs_name`
- `enrl_ever_w2_grad_any`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can
observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation
- Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas
(i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).
- Drop high schools with less than 20 students in the sample.

**Ask Yourself**

- How does college persistence for enrollers at 2-year colleges compare to 
enrollers at 4-year colleges? Given another year of sample data, how does 
college persistence for seamless enrollers compare to delayed enrollers?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Consider establishing MOUs with local 
community colleges to obtain detailed data on graduatesâ€™ postsecondary pursuits 
at two-year colleges (Course enrollment and transcript data) allowing agencies 
to explore persistence rates by assignment to remediation coursework.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who persist to the 
second year of college by the high school those students first attended.

## Persistence Across Two-Year and Four-Year Colleges

**Purpose:** This analysis provides a snapshot of persistence to the second 
year of college from one type of college to another for different high schools 
in the system. The left analysis charts explores how seamless enrollers in 
4-year colleges either persist at a 4-year or switch to a 2-year. The right 
analysis charts how seamless enrollers in 2-year colleges either persist at a 
2-year or switch to a 4-year.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_any`
- `enrl_grad_persist_4yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_2yr`
- `last_hs_code`
- `last_hs_name`


**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep the three most recent cohorts of graduates for which
persistence in college over four consecutive years can be
reported.
- Keep only graduates enrolled in 4-yr colleges and universities
the fall following high school graduation.
- Keep only graduates for whom cumulative high school GPAs
can be calculated (or obtained from the agency)
- Only include the top six enrolling 4-year colleges
- Only report persistence rates among students falling in each
high school GPA category if the sample includes 25 or more
students

**Ask Yourself**

- How do the rates of persistence or switching differ for seamless enrollers at 
4-year vs. 2-year colleges?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Create individual school-level reports 
for administrators and college counselors to communicate which postsecondary
institutions are associated with greater rates of persistence. Additionally, 
conduct similar analyses that include more detailed institutional information
that may be associated with studentsâ€™ prospects of persisting (e.g. cost of 
tuition and room/board, financial aid, etc.).

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of 4-yr college-goers who 
persist through four years of college by the postsecondary institution first 
attended and cumulative high school GPA category.

## Top-Enrolling Colleges/Universities of Agency Graduates

**Purpose:** This analysis reports enrollment and persistence rates among 
top-enrolling two- and four- year institutions attended by graduates. This 
analysis illuminates differences in persistence rates to the second year of 
college among top-enrolling postsecondary institutions. Agency staff that 
advise students during their senior year may find this information useful when 
meeting to weigh college options.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_any`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_4yr`
- `enrl_1oct_grad_yr1_2yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_any`
- `enrl_grad_persist_4yr`
- `enrl_grad_persist_2yr`
- `first_college_name_any`
- `first_college_name_2yr`
- `first_college_name_4yr`

** Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep only the most recent cohort of seamless college-goers
for which persistence to the second year of college can be
reported
- Only include postsecondary institutions with 25 or more
agency graduates attending.

**Ask Yourself**

- What are the top enrolling 4-year and 2-year colleges or universities in your 
agency? What are the persistence rates at those colleges and universities?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of college-goers attending
top-enrolling 2- and 4-year institutions, as well as the proportion of seamless
enrollers who persist to the second year of any college, by the postsecondary
institution graduates first attended.
