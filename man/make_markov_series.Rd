\details{
A Transition Matrix is a 2x2 matrix where:
\itemize{
 \item Element 1, 1 is the probability of moving to state 0 conditional on being in state 0
 \item Element 2, 1 is the probability of moving to state 0 conditional on being in state 1
 \item Element 1, 2 is the probability of moving to state 1 conditional on being in state 0
 \item Element 2, 2 is the probability of moving to state 1 conditional on being in state 1
