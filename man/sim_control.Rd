\description{
Set control parameters for simulated data
}
\details{
This function has a full set of default values that are designed to
produce realistic data. These defaults can be overridden by specifying any
of the arguments to be overridden as an option to the function call.

There are two unique data structures that are used to set options for simulations.
The first is a \code{probability_list}, a list which defines a grouping factor, and
for each level of the grouping factor a function and parameters to generate
probability distribution from.

The \code{sim_parameters} data structure defines the parameters for the outcome
simulation. Outcomes are simulated using a simulated multilevel model structure
and this data structure contains the parameters that describe the model and the
error structure of data generated from that model.

To modify either of these elements, use the \code{\link{validate_probability_list}}
or \code{\link{validate_sim_parameter}} helper functions to ensure that all
of the parameters are defined with valid values.
